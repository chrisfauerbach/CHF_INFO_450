# Introduction

# 

<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 2em;line-height:1.8em;">
<strong>Programming</strong> <br/>
is the process
of creating a set of
instructions that tell a
computer how to perform a
task. Programming can be
done using a variety of
computer languages
</div>

# Why learn to program?
 All the reasons!

 + Programming help develop problem solving skills 
 + Programming teaches you how to think in both structured and create way
 + Programming makes things easier
 + Programming teaches you persistence 
 + Check out developer salary ranges
 + It’s cool...

# Why are we learning C++?

<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 2em;line-height:1.8em;">
<strong>Python</strong> is obviously the best language in the universe.  C++ is a much lower level language, closer to how the machine works.

# Comments
<strong>Comments</strong> are statements that
do not affect the compiling or
running of a program

Comments are simply
explanatory remarks that the
programmer includes in a
program to clarify what is taking
place

These remarks are useful to
later program users because
they might help explain the
intent of a particular statement
or the purpose of the entire
program

C++ supports both line and block comments

```c++
//  A line comment

/* 
  a block comment
*/
```

# Preprocessors and Namespace

A preprocessor is a tool that runs before
the actual compilation starts.

Preprocessor directives are commands
for the preprocessor and always start
with a pound sign \#

<strong>\#include <iostream></strong> is a preprocessor
directive that tells the preprocessor to
include the iostream standard header file

Header files are files that contain
predefined values and routines

The ` < >` tells the compiler to look in
predefined header directories only
(generally where the STL is kept).

`""` tells to compiler to look in the local
directory, and usually the predefined
header directories as

A namespace preprocessor directive tells
the compiler that the subsequent code is
making use of names in the specified
namespace. In this case, `namespace std`
refers to the C standard library

---
# Main
Every C++ program contains at least
one function, and that function is
called `main()`

The body of every function in a C++
program is a sequence of
statements contained in curly
braces, also known as curly brackets
```c++
{ }
```

All complete C++ statements end
with a semicolon

It is a standardized convention that
function `main()` is declared with
an int preceding it. `int` is the return
value type of the function `main()`.

The programmer can use the return
value of `main()` to convey a success
or error state to the parent
application.

Conventionally a `0` is returned for
success and non-zero failure

---

# cout

The cout in the statement the
writes "Hello World" to the console
screen is a stream defined in the
standard (std) namespace

The insertion operator () is used
to put the text "Hello World" into
the stream.

The endl is used to end the line (like
a carriage return and/or new line)

The compiler was able to compile
Line that contains cout because we
instructed the preprocessor to
include the definition of std::cout in with 

```c++
#include <iostream.h>
``` 

and
identified the appropriate namespace

```c++
namespace std;
```

---
--- 

# Why namespaces?

With namespace declaration:
```c++
namespace std;
int main()
{
  cout << "Hi mom!" << endl;
}
```
Without namespace declaration:
```c++
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hi mom!" << endl;
}
```

# Building your program

1. Preprocessor

  * Takes the source code and evaluates the preprocessor directives (e.g. #includes, #defines, etc)

  * Generates a preprocessed source files

2. Compiling

  * Takes the preprocessed source code and compiles to object code
  * Check for syntax and semantic rules (e.g. type checking)

3. Linking
  * Takes the object files and links them into an executable program
